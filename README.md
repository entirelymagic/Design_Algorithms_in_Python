## Chapter 1
1. Define a Rational class to create rational numbers from 2 integers
2. Raise `ZeroDivisionError` if denominator from Rational is not different from 0.
3. Create the method __add__ in order to add 2 rational numbers
    - Created a function `cmmnc` that given 2 numbers get the lowest denominator 
    - Apply the `cmmnc` function to the add function in order to get an irreducible fraction
    
4.  Created `__eq__` to Rational class in order to check if 2 Rational objects are equal or not.
5.
